The following is a collection of projects I have worked on in the past for both
university, current, and past jobs. Any source code that is publicly available
can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/greatgitsby) or [my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/trey.moen).

# Personal

## [Portfolio (this site)](/)

I created a website to hold portfolio items like this, my resume, as well as
create "blog-like" posts to keep track of my own personal development.
It is a Markdown-based blog site built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and is
hosted entirely in my own "cloud" (writing a post on it soon!). My site is open-source, viewable on [GitHub](https://github.com/greatgitsby/portfolio)
if you would like to look through the code. I wrote a translation layer for
[react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) to enable
easy integration and theming with the [Material UI](https://mui.com) framework. I hope to
publish this soon!

## [Wedding Homepage](https://owen2moen.com)

I created a website for the wedding of myself and my incredible, super awesome fianc√©e
[Avery Owen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avery-owen-3502b8168). It links to our RSVP system, hosts a page for our registries, and
displays a gallery of images on the homepage. Feel free to view it
at [owen2moen.com](https://owen2moen.com).
Source code is [here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/wedding).

## [GFU Engineering Project Ideation Commission](https://gfuprojects.com)

This website is for my Servant Engineering project during my third year at
Fox. We created a workflow and set of resources for teachers at a local high
school to submit project ideas and have us create what they had envisioned.
Feel free to view it at [gfuprojects.com](https://gfuprojects.com).
The source is located [here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/gfu-project-site).

## HansenLite compiler

I wrote a compiler for the HansenLite language, created by Dr. David Hansen
of George Fox University. It targets the ARMv7 assembly language, is written in Java and located
[here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/hlc).

# Work
## E&J Gallo Winery - AWS GuardDuty Alert and Auto-remediation System

I developed an alert and auto-remediation system powered by AWS GuardDuty,
a threat detection service powered by machine learning. Personnel are notified
via Microsoft Teams and compromised resources are contained or disabled when
GuardDuty detects a new Finding, all in real-time. Implemented with Lambda,
SQS, CloudFormation, Secrets Manager, and some vendor APIs to facilitate
remediations.

## Simple Monitors - Client Dashboard

I built a dashboard for Simple Monitors clients to manage their webhook
configurations, authentication, and release channels. It leverages
HTML/CSS/jQuery and is served by a simple Node.js application and it runs
on a simple Heroku configuration. 

## Simple Monitors - Web Scraper Administration Dashboard

I built a dashboard for internal management of sites and products monitored
by our web scraping platform. Each site 'platform' has a dedicated page to
display its active configurations and perform C.R.U.D. operations.

## Simple Monitors - Scalable Web Scraping Platform 

The management dashboard would hold very little value without the scraping
platform itself. I created a fully distributed scraping platform to monitor
product additions and restocks. The platform is backed by a Kubernetes
cluster and leverages technologies like Redis, an MPI-like layer on top of
Redis, and various Node.js microservices.

## Simple Monitors - Database REST API

I built a REST API for accessing our database configurations. It supported
JWT and API key authentication and scope-based access for those using JWT
to access (our admin dashboard). I used TypeScript and MongoDB as the
primary technologies for this project, and it was hosted on a multi-node
Heroku application.

## Simple Monitors - HTTP client for TLS spoofing

I designed an HTTP client that allows for spoofing of TLS Client-Hello
packets. These inital packets are used in many bot protections and allowed
for fine-tuning of our scrapers to look like authentic browsers, even past a
User-Agent modification. The library was written in Node.js and bootstrapped
to a Go program that facilitated the network requests.

## Simple Monitors - Grafana Implementation

I implemented Grafana and Prometheus to get live stats on our distribution
pipeline and overall Kubernetes cluster health. Below is an abbrevatied view
of the dashboard I created.
