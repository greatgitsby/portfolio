The following is a collection of projects I have worked on in the past for both
university, current, and past jobs. Any source code that is publicly available
can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/greatgitsby).

# personal

## [portfolio (this site)](https://treymoen.com)

I created a website to hold portfolio items like this, my resume, as well as
create "blog-like" posts to keep track of my own personal development.
It is a Markdown-based blog site built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and is
hosted entirely inside AWS using their [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify)
service. It is hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/greatgitsby/portfolio)
if you would like to view the source.

## [wedding website](https://owen2moen.com)

I created a website for the wedding of myself and my super awesome fianc√©e
Avery Owen. It will soon have RSVP functionality, custom wedding invite
details, a page for our registry links, as well as a gallery of images on the
homepage. Feel free to view it at [owen2moen.com](https://owen2moen.com).

# university
## [gfu epic website](https://gfuprojects.com)

This website is for my Servant Engineering project during my third year at
Fox. We created a workflow and set of resources for teachers at a local high
school to submit project ideas and have us create what they had envisioned.
Feel free to view it at [gfuprojects.com](https://gfuprojects.com).
The source is located [here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/gfu-project-site).

## HansenLite compiler

I wrote a compiler for the HansenLite language, created by Dr. David Hansen
of George Fox University. It is written in Java and located
[here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/hlc).

# work
## e&j gallo winery - aws guardduty alert and auto-remediation system

I developed an alert and auto-remediation system powered by AWS GuardDuty,
a threat detection service powered by machine learning. Personnel are notified
via Microsoft Teams and compromised resources are contained or disabled when
GuardDuty detects a new Finding, all in real-time. Implemented with Lambda,
SQS, CloudFormation, Secrets Manager, and some vendor APIs to facilitate
remediations.

## simple monitors - client dashboard

I built a dashboard for Simple Monitors clients to manage their webhook
configurations, authentication, and release channels. It leverages
HTML/CSS/jQuery and is served by a simple Node.js application and it runs
on a simple Heroku configuration. 

## simple monitors - admin dashboard

I built a dashboard for internal management of sites and products monitored
by our web scraping platform. Each site 'platform' has a dedicated page to
display its active configurations and perform C.R.U.D. operations.

## simple monitors - web scraper platform 

The management dashboard would hold very little value without the scraping
platform itself. I created a fully distributed scraping platform to monitor
product additions and restocks. The platform is backed by a Kubernetes
cluster and leverages technologies like Redis, an MPI-like layer on top of
Redis, and various Node.js microservices.

## simple monitors - database rest api

I built a REST API for accessing our database configurations. It supported
JWT and API key authentication and scope-based access for those using JWT
to access (our admin dashboard). I used TypeScript and MongoDB as the
primary technologies for this project, and it was hosted on a multi-node
Heroku application.

## simple monitors - http client for tls spoofing

I designed an HTTP client that allows for spoofing of TLS Client-Hello
packets. These inital packets are used in many bot protections and allowed
for fine-tuning of our scrapers to look like authentic browsers, even past a
User-Agent modification. The library was written in Node.js and bootstrapped
to a Go program that facilitated the network requests.

## simple monitors - grafana implementation

I implemented Grafana and Prometheus to get live stats on our distribution
pipeline and overall Kubernetes cluster health. Below is an abbrevatied view
of the dashboard I created.
